I currently work on [Presto][1], an open-source large-scale distributed SQL engine, at Facebook. Before coming to Facebook, I co-founded Carsabi, a search engine for used cars.

I majored in EECS and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley. At Cal, I was part of the [STARMAC][2] research project, and still dabble in drones in my free time. I've built my own quadrotors and am the creator of [Rospilot][3].
