![blinking LED](/images/2010-03-19-blinking-led.jpg)

I decided to learn how to program microcontrollers. SparkFun has some really good tutorials <http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/tutorials.php>. So far nothing too exciting, but I managed to compile and load the code onto the microcontroller and make a blinking LED =P
